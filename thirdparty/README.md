# Third-Party Documents Directory

This directory contains external documents, reports, and materials collected across **all investigations**. All materials are organized by **trust level** to ensure proper source evaluation per the Analyst SOP.

**Location:** `/thirdparty/` (project root level, shared across all reports)

---

## Directory Structure

### `/trusted/`
**Criteria:** Official government documents, verified law enforcement reports, authenticated court records, peer-reviewed publications.

**Examples:**
- BKA press releases
- Generalbundesanwalt official statements
- Stromnetz Berlin technical specifications
- Academic papers on grid security
- Verified forensic reports

**Handling:** Can be cited directly with standard source attribution.

---

### `/unverified/`
**Criteria:** Documents from credible sources but not independently verified, media reports, industry publications, technical documentation without official authentication.

**Examples:**
- News articles (Tagesspiegel, Spiegel, taz)
- Industry reports on critical infrastructure
- Technical manuals from manufacturers
- Social media posts from verified accounts
- Wikipedia articles (pre-verification)

**Handling:** Must be cross-referenced with other sources. Use "according to [source]" language. Flag as unverified in analysis.

---

### `/disinformation/`
**Criteria:** Known or suspected disinformation, propaganda materials, manipulated documents, false flag content.

**Examples:**
- Rybar/WarGonzo amplification content
- Manipulated Indymedia posts
- Fake Vulkangruppe statements
- Russian state media narratives
- Coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) materials

**Handling:** **DO NOT cite as factual.** Use only for attribution analysis, narrative mapping, and information warfare documentation. Always label as "disinformation" or "suspected disinformation" in reports.

---

### `/leaked/`
**Criteria:** Leaked documents, whistleblower materials, data breaches, unauthorized disclosures.

**Examples:**
- Vulkan Files (NTC Vulkan leak)
- Crystal-2V training materials
- Internal communications
- Classified or restricted documents

**Handling:** Verify authenticity through multiple sources. Consider legal and ethical implications. Use with extreme caution. Document chain of custody. Flag as "leaked/unverified" until authenticated.

---

### `/ai_generated/`
**Criteria:** Reports, summaries, or analyses generated by AI systems (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.), AI-assisted OSINT tools, automated threat intelligence platforms.

**Examples:**
- AI-generated threat intelligence summaries
- ChatGPT/Claude analysis of events
- Perplexity research reports
- Automated OSINT platform outputs
- AI-translated documents

**Handling:** **MUST be verified against primary sources.** AI-generated content can contain hallucinations, outdated information, or biased interpretations. Use ONLY as starting points for research, never as authoritative sources. Always cross-reference with trusted sources.

**⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS:**
- **AI can hallucinate facts** - Verify all claims independently
- **AI has knowledge cutoffs** - May not reflect recent events
- **AI can amplify biases** - Cross-check with diverse sources
- **Never cite as authoritative** - Use "AI analysis suggests..." language

---

## Analyst SOP Compliance

Per the **Analyst SOP (ACH Framework)**, all third-party documents must be:

1. **Source Evaluated:** Assess credibility, bias, and potential manipulation
2. **Cross-Referenced:** Verify claims against multiple independent sources
3. **Contextualized:** Understand the document's origin, purpose, and intended audience
4. **Documented:** Record source, acquisition date, and trust assessment

### Trust Level Matrix

| Trust Level | Citation Standard | Verification Required | Use in ACH Matrix |
|-------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Trusted** | Direct citation | Standard fact-checking | High weight |
| **Unverified** | "According to [source]" | Cross-reference with 2+ sources | Medium weight |
| **Disinformation** | "Claimed by [source]" | Do not use as evidence | Attribution only |
| **Leaked** | "Leaked documents suggest" | Authenticate with experts | Low-Medium weight |
| **AI Generated** | "AI analysis suggests" | Verify all claims with primary sources | Low weight (research starting point only) |

---

## Document Naming Convention

Use the following format for all third-party documents:

```
YYYYMMDD_source_type_description.ext
```

**Examples:**
- `20260106_bka_press_release_reward_announcement.pdf` (trusted)
- `20260103_tagesspiegel_news_lichterfelde_attack.pdf` (unverified)
- `20260104_rybar_telegram_energy_suicide_narrative.pdf` (disinformation)
- `20230315_vulkan_files_crystal2v_training_manual.pdf` (leaked)
- `20260213_perplexity_ai_berlin_attack_summary.pdf` (ai_generated)

---

## Metadata Requirements

Each document should have an accompanying `.meta.json` file with:

```json
{
  "filename": "document_name.pdf",
  "source": "Organization/Individual",
  "acquisition_date": "2026-02-13",
  "trust_level": "trusted|unverified|disinformation|leaked|ai_generated",
  "verification_status": "verified|pending|unverifiable",
  "related_investigations": ["20260213_142123_berlin_grid_attack_eg_volt"],
  "analyst_notes": "Brief assessment of reliability and relevance",
  "cross_references": ["related_document_1.pdf", "related_document_2.pdf"]
}
```

## Handling Disinformation Materials

When working with materials in `/disinformation/`:

⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNINGS:**
1. **Never cite as factual evidence**
2. **Always label as disinformation in reports**
3. **Use only for attribution analysis** (who is pushing what narrative)
4. **Document the disinformation campaign**, not the false claims
5. **Cross-reference with trusted sources** to identify contradictions

**Acceptable Use Cases:**
- Mapping information warfare campaigns
- Identifying coordinated narratives
- Attribution analysis (linking actors to narratives)
- Timeline reconstruction of disinformation deployment

---

## Linking to Reports

When referencing third-party documents in investigation reports, use:

```markdown
**Source:** [Document Name](file:///absolute/path/to/thirdparty/trusted/document.pdf) (Trusted)
**Source:** [Document Name](file:///absolute/path/to/thirdparty/unverified/document.pdf) (Unverified - cross-reference required)
**Source:** [Document Name](file:///absolute/path/to/thirdparty/disinformation/document.pdf) (Disinformation - attribution analysis only)
```
